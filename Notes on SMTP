SMTP uses SSL (secure socket layer) or TlS (transport layer security)
library socket may be used

bron : https://mailtrap.io/blog/smtp/

sender's email client = SMTP client
sender's email server = SMTP server

client initiates a connection and transmits email
server processes this email and determines suitable next server

once connection is established, client will transfer data
transmission done? => connection closed

smtp can only send plain text

socket.bind != socket.connect , wat is wat??

  MAIL <SP> FROM:<reverse-path> <CRLF>


        username = findUsername(text)
        if username == 0:
            str = input("S: ")
            c.send(str.encode())
        else:
            with open(username +"/my_mailbox","a") as myfile:
                myfile.write(text)
