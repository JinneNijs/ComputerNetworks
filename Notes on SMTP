SMTP uses SSL (secure socket layer) or TlS (transport layer security)
library socket may be used

bron : https://mailtrap.io/blog/smtp/

sender's email client = SMTP client
sender's email server = SMTP server

client initiates a connection and transmits email
server processes this email and determines suitable next server

once connection is established, client will transfer data
transmission done? => connection closed

smtp can only send plain text

socket.bind != socket.connect , wat is wat??
